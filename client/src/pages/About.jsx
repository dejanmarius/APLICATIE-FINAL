          Employers can effortlessly upload job listings, providing detailed
          descriptions to attract the right candidates. Job seekers, on the
          other hand, can explore a dedicated jobs view page, where they can
          browse through a myriad of opportunities tailored to their skills and
          preferences. The platform also includes a unique Job News section,
          aggregating the latest industry updates through tweets sourced from

          application notifications, ensuring that job seekers receive timely
          updates on their job applications. This feature helps bridge the
          communication gap between employers and applicants, fostering a more
